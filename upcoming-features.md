# Future plans

OT Genetics is a resource in progress

* Formal disease-molecular trait co-localisation analysis
* More functional data, including the upcoming Open Targets-European Bioinformatics Institute eQTL database
* More full summary statistics, meaning more fine-mapping / coloc
* Therapeutic area specific profiles \(e.g. only include functional data relevant to immune-related disease in variant-to-gene assignment/scoring\)
