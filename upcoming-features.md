# Future Plans

Open Targets Genetics is a resource in progress. Enhancements to the existing product, and the development of new functionality and features will be ongoing. Selected scheduled enhancements are detailed below:  

* Disease-molecular trait co-localisation analysis
* Integration of new molecular QTL datasets, including the upcoming Open Targets-European Bioinformatics Institute eQTL database
* Integration of GWAS Catalog summary statistic database, meaning more fine-mapping, colocalisation and PheWAS
* Therapeutic-area specific profiles \(e.g. only include functional data relevant to immune-related disease in variant-to-gene assignment/scoring\)
