# Future Plans

There are some of the new functionalities and data coming up in future releases of Open Targets Genetics:

* Therapeutic-area specific profiles \(e.g. only include functional data relevant to immune-related disease in variant-to-gene assignment/scoring\)
* Tissue/SNP enrichment across diseases and traits \(CHEERS method\) 
* Mendelian Randomisation \(6 proteomic summary stat data\) 
* Tissue/trait-specific ‘Locus to Gene’ score 
* PheWAS based on rare variants
