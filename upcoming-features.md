# Future Plans

There are some of the new functionalities and data coming up in future releases of Open Targets Genetics:

* Tissue/SNP enrichment across diseases and traits (CHEERS method)&#x20;
* Mendelian Randomisation (6 proteomic summary stat data)&#x20;
* Tissue/trait-specific ‘Locus to Gene’ score&#x20;
* Therapeutic-area specific profiles (e.g. only include functional data relevant to immune-related disease in variant-to-gene assignment/scoring)
* PheWAS based on rare variants

To be informed of future updates, follow Open Targets on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OpenTargets) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/open-targets), and keep an eye on the [Open Targets Blog](https://blog.opentargets.org/) and [Open Targets Community](https://community.opentargets.org/).
