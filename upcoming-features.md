# Future Plans

Open Targets Genetics is a resource in progress. Enhancements to the existing product, and the development of new functionality and features will be ongoing. Selected scheduled enhancements are detailed below:  

* Formal disease-molecular trait co-localisation analysis
* More functional data, including the upcoming Open Targets-European Bioinformatics Institute eQTL database
* More full summary statistics, meaning more fine-mapping / coloc
* Therapeutic area specific profiles \(e.g. only include functional data relevant to immune-related disease in variant-to-gene assignment/scoring\)
