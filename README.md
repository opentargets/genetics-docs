# Introduction

Open Targets Genetics is a portal highlighting variant-centric statistical evidence for prioritizing candidate causal variants at trait-associated loci, and identifying potential drug targets. 

It is based on a apache spark pipeline which merges genetic associations curated from literature with functional genomics, epigenetic and expression data \(e.g., eQTL, promoter capture Hi-C, DNase hypersensitivity sites, regulatory elements\) to resolve association signals at a locus and link each variant to its target gene\(s\) using a single evidence score. Take a look at our dataset list.

The portal also incorporates pre-computed fine-mapping at trait-associated loci across hundreds of UK Biobank phenotypes as well as cross-trait colocalization, furthering drug repurposing opportunities. The aim of the portal is to enable biological insight, prioritize genes, and inform target decision-making.  


### About Open Targets

Open Targets integrates large-scale genetics and genomics with drug information, influencing the way drug targets are identified and prioritized. It also generates new data using human cell models and genome editing to identify drug targets for three main therapeutic areas: oncology, immunology, and neurodegeneration. The Open Targets Platform enables users to investigate links between genes, pathways, and diseases.
