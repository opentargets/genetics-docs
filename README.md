# Introduction

Open Targets Genetics \(OT Genetics\) is a portal highlighting variant-centric statistical evidence to allow prioritisation of candidate causal variants at trait-associated loci, and identification of potential drug targets. 

The portal aggregates and merges genetic associations curated from literature with \(open source\) functional genomics, epigenetic and expression data \(e.g., eQTLs, regulatory elements\), and applies statistical fine-mapping across thousands of trait-associated loci, to resolve association signals and link each variant to its target gene\(s\) using a single evidence score. Integrated cross-trait colocalisation analyses and cross-linking to details of pharmaceutical compounds extend the capacity of the platform to explore drug repositioning opportunities and shared genetic architecture. Take a look at our [Data Pipeline](our-approach/data-pipeline.md) and [Data Sources](our-approach/data-sources.md#overview-of-data-sources) for more detailed information.

Whatever your starting point - gene, trait or variant - OT Genetics enables detailed biological insight  and causal gene prioritisation, and informs target decision making.  It can be used to answer specific biological and target hypotheses, or as an exploratory tool - for example, to rapidly prioritise genes at associated loci in a new GWAS.  Get started now   

### About Open Targets

Open Targets integrates large-scale genetics and genomics with drug information, influencing the way drug targets are identified and prioritized. It also generates new data using human cell models and genome editing to identify drug targets for three main therapeutic areas: oncology, immunology, and neurodegeneration. The Open Targets Platform enables users to investigate links between genes, pathways, and diseases.
