# ASHG Workshop 2018

Good Morning, and welcome to this workshop, '**Open Targets:  Using Genetics and Functional Genomics to Identify and Prioritise Targets for New Medicines**'.  Over the next 90 minutes, we will guide you through the detailed functionality of Open Targets' new Portal for Statistical Geneticists - OT Genetics.

#### Why a New Portal?

OT Genetics builds on the successes of the original Open Targets Platform \(targetvalidation.org\)
