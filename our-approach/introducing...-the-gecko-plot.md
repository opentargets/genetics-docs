# Introducing... the Locus Plot

Many pages in the portal are centred on a new plot designed to effectively summarise the complexity of the links between numerous genes \(targets\), traits, and lead variants.  We call this the Locus Plot.  

The Locus Plot uses a track-style browser to display a locus which can be centred on a gene, variant, or trait of interest \(each known as an **entity**\).  Connecting traits, variants and genes are **evidence strings** which indicate an association or functional link between the entities; i.e. a link indicates that there is at least one element of functional data in at least one cell by which the two entities are associated.  When navigating to the Locus Plot, certain entities will be pre-selected based on context; filters and selections can be altered at any time by clicking an entity or removing it from the applied filters.  

The example below highlights the main features of the plot and should help you familiarise yourself with its concepts.  In this case, one variant from one study has been selected to identify the targets prioritised as functional at this locus.
