# Assigning Genes to Loci

All polymorphic variants in the genome \(both trait- associated and not\) are comprehensively annotated by cross-referencing to a range of functional and biological data.  This is the **aggregation stage**.  The subsequent **scoring stage** uses a weighted approach to collapse the complex cell type-specfic annotations for each variant into a single score which summarises the strength of evidence by which a variant implicates a given gene.  Using this score, the list of implicated genes for a given variant can be ranked and prioritised from those most likely to be causal to those of least interest.  Cross-referencing to other Open Targets resources allows the viability of these genes as drug targets to then be assesssed.
