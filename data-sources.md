# Data Sources

The public data sources leveraged by OT Genetics broadly fall into one of two categories based on the 'resolution' of the genetic component of the original analyses; \(1\) variant-centric and \(2\) interval-based.  

**Variant-centric** **data** directly annotate variants with functional consequences, and would include, for example, eQTL datasets, in which the Beta and SE of association with gene expression levels are provided in a variant-by-variant manner, in a conventional summary statistics-type format.  

**Interval data** assess the association between a region of the genome, often pre-selected on the basis of a biological or regulatory prior \(e.g. an enhancer\), and other functional elements proximal or distal to it.  As such, association statistics are not immediately available for each separate variant.  Instead, OT Genetics maps the defined genomic regions used as the base unit of analyses to variants falling within these intervals, using standard genomic maps.
